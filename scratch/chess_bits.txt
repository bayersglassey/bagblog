Some unused stuff from "Irreversible Chess", "An Algebra of Chess", etc.


===========================================================

## Other rules

In the basic variant - that is, chess where pieces must always move
forwards, even when taking - there is not much point in running a pawn
to the opposing rank, and converting it into a queen or any other piece,
since it will be unable to move in any case.
However, we might instead say that when a pawn is on the opposing rank,
it may be replaced with a queen or other non-pawn piece on the *home*
rank of the same file.

That is, the pawn in the following diagram may be replaced by a queen,
knight, bishop, or rook on the square marked with an "X":

    .....♙..
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    .....X..

This would be irreversible, but might add some flavour to the "late game"
of our chess variant.

Alternatively (or in addition), we might say that pawns are able to take
(or at least give check) on the home rank from the opposing rank.
That is, in the following diagram, the pawn may take on either of the
squares marked with an "X":

    .....♙..
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ........
    ....X.X.

This is particularly relevant if the enemy king has made it to your home
rank!.. you can deliver check mate to him from across the board.


======================================================

In fact, we can use our algebra to describe how the pieces are allowed to move.
For instance, we can write `♘ + uur♟` to describe the situation where a knight
could take a pawn, and `. + uur♘` to describe the situation where the knight
has taken the pawn:

    Knight could take pawn:

     ♟

    ♘

    Knight has taken pawn:

     ♘

    .

And we can invent a new syntax to represent that move: `(♘ + uur♟) -> (. + uur♘)`
