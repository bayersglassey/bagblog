# BAG Blog

The blog of BAG.

I was almost an academic, but instead became a software engineer.

Written as a Git repo of Markdown files, to be published on some Git hosting site or other.

Blog entries can be found, organized by year and month, in the [entries/ directory](entries/).

Greatest hits (chosen arbitrarily by myself):
* [GEOM2018 & Spider Game](entries/2021/oct/spidergame.md)
* [Irreversible Chess](entries/2025/jul/irreversible_chess.md)
* [An Algebra of Chess](entries/2025/jul/algebra_of_chess.md)
