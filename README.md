# BAG Blog

The blog of BAG.

I was almost an academic, but instead became a software engineer.

Written as a Git repo of Markdown files, to be published on some Git hosting site or other.

Blog entries can be found, organized by year and month, in the [entries/](entries/) directory.

Greatest hits (chosen arbitrarily by myself):
* [Irreversible Chess](entries/2025/jul/irreversible_chess.md)
* [An Algebra of Chess](entries/2025/jul/algebra_of_board_game_positions.md)
